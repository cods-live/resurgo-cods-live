# asked gpt what is the probability of a collision where three TOTP tokens match for two different users when using only TOTP for registration and login

## gpt:

TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is a widely used mechanism for two-factor authentication. It generates a temporary, time-limited code based on a shared secret and the current time. The security of TOTP relies on the uniqueness of the shared secret and the limited time window for each code.

### Capacity and Collision Probability

1. **Capacity**:
   - The capacity of a TOTP system is theoretically unlimited in terms of the number of users, as each user has a unique shared secret.
   - The practical limit is determined by the infrastructure and the ability to manage and store the shared secrets securely.

2. **Collision Probability**:
   - TOTP codes are typically 6 digits long, giving 1,000,000 possible combinations (from 000000 to 999999).
   - The probability of two users having the same TOTP code at the same time is low, but not zero.

### Probability of Collision for 3 TOTP Tokens

When you ask for 3 TOTP tokens, the probability of a collision (i.e., two users having the same set of 3 tokens) can be calculated using the birthday paradox principle.

- **Single TOTP Token Collision**:
  - Probability of collision for a single token: \( \frac{1}{1,000,000} \).

- **Three TOTP Tokens Collision**:
  - The probability of all three tokens colliding simultaneously is \( \left(\frac{1}{1,000,000}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{10^{18}} \).

### Practical Considerations

- **Shared Secret Uniqueness**: Ensure that each user has a unique shared secret to minimize the risk of collisions.
- **Time Window**: TOTP codes are time-based, typically changing every 30 seconds. This further reduces the chance of collision.
- **Security Measures**: Implement additional security measures such as rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, and monitoring for unusual login patterns.

### Conclusion

The probability of a collision where three TOTP tokens match for two different users is extremely low (\( \frac{1}{10^{18}} \)). Therefore, the system can support a very large number of users with a negligible risk of accidental login collisions. However, always ensure robust security practices to manage shared secrets and monitor for potential security breaches.
